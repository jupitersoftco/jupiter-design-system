- [ ] Theme optimization based on usage
```

### **7.4 Component Generation**

```rust
// jupiter-design-system/src/generation/
Tasks:
- [ ] AI component scaffolding
- [ ] Pattern-based component creation
- [ ] Test generation for new components
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Migration path generation
```

## 🎯 **Vision: AI-Enhanced Design System**

### **End State Goals**

- **Universal Design Language** - Consistent patterns across all Dioxus components
- **AI-Enhanced Development** - Intelligent pattern suggestions and optimizations
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal bundle impact with intelligent code splitting
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliance built-in with AI verification
- **Developer Joy** - Simple, powerful, predictable APIs with intelligent assistance

### **Revolutionary Impact**

This work will establish Jupiter Design System as the foundation for the **next generation of Dioxus-focused design systems** - moving beyond static components to **intelligent, adaptive, AI-enhanced design patterns** that learn from usage patterns and optimize for performance and accessibility automatically.

The AI-driven features will assist developers in:

- **Automatic Pattern Selection** - Suggest optimal patterns based on context
- **Performance Optimization** - Recommend efficient pattern combinations
- **Accessibility Compliance** - Automatically verify and enhance accessibility
- **Code Quality** - Provide intelligent refactoring suggestions
- **Theme Generation** - Create cohesive, accessible color schemes
